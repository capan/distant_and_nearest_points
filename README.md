# Distant & Nearest Points Problem

This is my implementation for comparing perfomance of same problem in Node.JS and Rust.

## Problem: 

Let's say you have a list of random X,Y coordinates. Find closest and farthest two.

### Run rust implementation
`cd rust`

`cargo run -r`

### Run Node implementation

`cd node`

`npm i`

`npm run start`

Adjust numbers to be created.
